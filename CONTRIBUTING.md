## Notebook contributions

To guarantee standardization for assets in Google repositories we have
put together some recommendations which will help Google provide
consistency and quality for the notebook assets:

Please make sure you follow the next steps when developing Notebooks:

   1. Clone and develop off of this notebook [templates](notebooks/templates)
   2. If notebook is meant as official documentation, work with techwriter on written content 
   3. Ensure notebook [requirements](#Notebook-requirements) are met
   4. Ensure notebook runs from top to bottom without errors
   5. Place the notebook in correct [location](#Notebooks-location)
   6. Create a pull request in a relevant repository
   7. Reviewers provide feedback and work with you to merge pull request

 
   If Colab is required please provide compatibility with AI Platform
   Notebooks, to help you on this we have created a template for you!
   [Template here](notebooks/templates/ai_platform_notebooks_template_hybrid.ipynb)
   
   ## Notebook requirements
   1. Use [AI Platform notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/)
   We highly recommend to guarantee that your Notebook runs in AI Platform Notebooks
   
   2. Use [templates](notebooks/templates) listed above. 
   3. Provide novel and relevant content 
   4. Provide Notebook documentation
   5. Use latest ML framework version
   6. Follow software engineering principles:
      - [Python style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)
      - Notebook code is [formatted](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/code_prettify/README_autopep8.html)
      - Use [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
      - Documentation      
      
   ## Notebooks location
   
   Add your notebook to the following folder: ai-platform-samples > notebooks > samples:
   
   - AutoML Tables
   - BigQuery
   - BigQuery ML
   
   For the following products, select the ML framework and place it accordingly:
   
   - AI Platform Training
   - AI Platform Prediction
   - AI Platform Explanations
   - AI Platform Notebooks
